# A flat 30 seconds was too thin a ceiling. On a quiet machine this is a rename and the

# one friends/fz67 snapshot hit the 30 s timeout on 11-04, on a volume at 92% capacity with
# tens of GB already in the Trash, and each killed move left the snapshot on disk and the
# harvest that had copied and verified it recorded as a failure. The condition is not
# reproduced, so the ceiling now simply scales with the tree rather than pretending to know
# the cost per file. It bounds a hang, not a wait, so it is generous; counting stops once
