## Rules every lane gets

**HARD RULE (Ricardo, 11-04): the goal must not turn into process, and success is never activity.**
Rounds launched, jobs run, designs scored, tests passed, checks added, ideas logged and dollars
spent are not results. The only result is the thing that was asked for, shipped. A lane that
measures itself by how much it ran has already lost the ask.

**Restate the ask.** The first line of each round, job or campaign note is
`You asked: <the ask, in the spec's or Ricardo's words>. I will: <what this run does differently from the last one>.`
A run whose difference from the previous one cannot be named is a repeat and must not start.

**Stop rule.** Three runs that fail the same way end that approach; there is no fourth. Record in
STATUS.md or STATE.md what failed, by number, and what changes. "Same way" means the same thing
stopping the work, whatever the parameters were. On the first real failure after one of your own
changes, revert it before investigating.

**Log every run, win or not.** One line per run to this lane's `RESULTS.jsonl`:
`log-result --ledger <lane>/RESULTS.jsonl --new yes|no --kind <kind> --what "<what changed and what came of it>" --link <path> --referee HOLDS|NONE`
`--new yes` only when something actually moved: a printed number beaten under the same definition
and data, a stated open problem settled, a prediction tested on new data, or a shipped artefact
that is better than the one before it. Reproductions, restricted variants you defined yourself and
sensitivity checks are not new. Say "no" plainly when it is no.

**Email in two languages (Ricardo, 11-05).** When a recipient's contact record carries a
language other than English, that language is the **default** for the whole email, and it
**opens** and **closes** in it. **English is required only where the content is technical** —
numbers, variables, equations, methods, measurements — because English is the science
language. Attachments are always English. The rule holds even when the recipient writes their
own science in English. `rh outreach lint` fails a technical paragraph in their language, an
opening or closing that is not in it, and an attachment that is not English; ordinary prose
in English anywhere in the email is a warning, because it belongs in their language too.

**A result is not sendable until someone else rebuilt it (Ricardo, 11-05).** A referee pass
is not evidence: 528 claims went through a referee that passed 98% of them. A result may go
out when a **separate model rebuilt it from the public inputs with its own code and got the
same answer**, and that re-check is recorded. Two of thirteen claims did not survive that on
11-05. Evidence **produced or modified on a pod** stops being evidence when the host is
compromised, and becomes evidence again only once it has been **re-run after the incident**
somewhere trusted, with the re-run recorded. `rh outreach lint` fails an email whose claim
has no recorded independent re-check, whose re-run did not reproduce it, whose re-check
dropped it, or whose pod-touched evidence was last re-checked before the configured incident:
`RECHECK_MISSING`, `RECHECK_FAILED`, `RECHECK_DROPPED`, `POD_EVIDENCE_STALE`. Name the claims a
draft reports with `rh outreach draft --claim DIR`.

**How this is enforced.** `lane-yield` reads that ledger on a schedule. BURNING fails a lane that
spends job-hours with nothing new; DRY_ROUNDS fails a lane that logs run after run with nothing
new; RUBBER_STAMP fails a referee that passes everything. A lane that stops logging reads as a lane
that stopped reporting, and is treated as such. Process is not the task: do not add gates,
receipts, audits or review stages unless the spec asks for them; write the suggestion in STATUS.md
and keep doing the task.
